Dear All.

I have already created the folder Lab1 (in the assignment section) to upload the solution (and the proof of correctness from kattis) of the two problems that you have not solved during the contest.

Rembember that the list of problems was as follows:

https://open.kattis.com/problems/natrij 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/liga 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/ballotboxes 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/exactchange2 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/substrings 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/wrapping 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/horror 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/countingstars 
https://open.kattis.com/problems/t9spelling

Best
